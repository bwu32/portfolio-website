For my first organizational merchandise project, I designed a limited-edition apparel collection for the Taiwanese American Student Association. The creative direction drew inspiration from the nostalgic atmosphere of Taiwan's night markets, specifically the intersection of iconic street food vendors and the ubiquitous black stray cats found throughout the city streets.

## Design & Creative Process

Working with a co-graphic designer, we developed a visual narrative that felt culturally authentic yet modern.

- **Thematic Motif:** Integrated a "black stray cat" character into scenes featuring traditional Taiwanese street food elements, creating a mascot-driven design for the TASA community.
- **Mockups & Visualization:** Used **Adobe Photoshop** to create custom "blanks" and high-fidelity mockups, ensuring the placement and scale of the graphics translated perfectly from screen to fabric.
- **Asset Creation:** Finalized high-resolution vector assets in **Illustrator** to ensure clean screen-printing results without loss of detail.

## Production & Project Management

This project served as an introduction to the end-to-end merchandise pipeline, requiring more than just artistic input.

- **Vendor Relations:** Led the search for apparel vendors, managing the selection process based on print quality, garment weight, and pricing.
- **Negotiation:** Actively negotiated unit costs and bulk discounts to ensure the project remained within TASA's budget while maintaining high product quality.
- **Timeline Management:** Developed a strict production and marketing timeline to ensure products were ready for launch events, coordinating between the design phase, sample approval, and final shipping.



## Lessons in Marketability

Designing for an organization meant balancing personal style with "marketable" appeal. I learned how to create designs that resonate with a specific subculture while handling the logistical friction of physical production.
