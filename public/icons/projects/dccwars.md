The *DCC Wars* series is basically a time capsule of my entire college experience. It’s a two-part saga that tracks my journey from a freshman just messing around with a camera to a senior trying to wrap up an Honors Capstone with some dignity. The best part? The "hero" lightsabers used in both films are actually the **Highborn** sabers I designed back in 2021.

## DCC Wars I: A Nu Hope (Freshman Final project)
This was the "final project" for our introductory DCC course (HDCC105). Looking back, it was total chaos in the best way possible. Me and my best friend spent a few days running around various iconic spots on the UMD campus, ignition sounds blaring, having the most intense lightsaber battle two freshmen could manage. 

- **The Vibe:** There was absolutely no plot. No dialogue, no motivation, just "I see you, you see me, let's fight." 
- **The Technicals:** To be honest, the special effects were pretty bad and the editing was rough, but it was our first time really trying to "make" something. It was pure creative joy, and it’s a project I still look back on fondly because of how much fun we had just being nerds on campus.

## DCC Wars II: The Exam Strikes Back (Capstone Project)
Fast forward a year, and we had to do our Capstone (HDCC209), which is the big, final project for the entire Honors program. We decided to bring it back to where it all started. While it’s the "sequel" because it’s me and my best friend fighting again, the stakes (and the production value) went through the roof.

- **The Plot:** It’s finals season at UMD. I’m playing a version of myself who is completely passed out in class, notebook filled with "Fortnite" doodles instead of notes. I realize I’m doomed for the final exam. An instigator (our friend Praneet) convinces me that if I take out the "Curve Destroyer" (the top student in the class) the curve will be my duo and I'll pass without studying. 
- **The Twist:** After a brutal battle, I realize the whole thing was a lie. Fighting the top student doesn't actually help my grade, and I was just being manipulated. It turned into a study on the futility of conflict and how we often start "wars" over total misinformation.

## Post-Production & "Faking It" in Premiere
This was my first real deep dive into **Premiere Pro**. I didn't have much experience with animation or heavy VFX, but I spent weeks "finessing" the software to do things it probably wasn't meant to do.

- **The "Wucasfilm" & "Janna+" Entros:** I wanted the film to feel "official," so I spent hours recreating the Lucasfilm and Disney+ intro animations. I didn't use dedicated animation software; I just manipulated layers, lighting effects, and keyframes inside Premiere until it looked satisfyingly "big budget."
- **Visuals & Storyboarding:** We actually sat down and storyboarded this one. We planned out camera cuts—panning across the DCC makerspace, zooming in on my blank notebook, and speed-ramping the fight scenes to make our "swordplay" look way more professional than it was.
- **Sound Design:** This was a huge learning curve. I had to layer in the classic Star Wars hums, the clash of the blades, and a soundtrack featuring **Samuel Kim’s** epic Star Wars remixes to give the scenes actual weight. 

## Why it Matters
This project was a culmination of storytelling, cinematography, and design. It proved that you don't need a massive studio to create something with energy and life—you just need a good story, a couple of custom-designed lightsabers, and the willingness to jump through a thousand hoops in Premiere Pro to make a logo look cool.
