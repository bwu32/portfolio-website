For my ENEE408V capstone, I led the structural and mechanical design for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed for depth regulation and obstacle avoidance. This project required balancing high-level processing via Raspberry Pi with real-time actuation through Arduino, all while maintaining a rigorous watertight sealing strategy.

## Mechanical Design & Structural Integrity

I served as the primary structural design expert, authoring all CAD drawings for external mounts and the primary electronics housing.

- **Sealing Strategy:** Engineered a watertight system using a plexiglass cylinder with custom-machined end caps. I utilized **CNC Milling & Turning** to create precise O-ring grooves to prevent water ingress.
- **Pressure Relief Innovation:** Integrated a custom **pressure valve hole** into the design. This allowed for easier disassembly by relieving internal air pressure during the O-ring fitting process.
- **Internal Architecture:** Designed and 3D modeled the entire internal component tray to ensure easy installation and modularity for the electronics stack.

## Fabrication & Rapid Prototyping

This project involved a massive manufacturing effort, including over **88 hours of 3D printing** across multiple iterations.

- **Material Usage:** Consumed **2,836 grams of filament** (excluding failures) to produce all internal and external vehicle components.
- **Machined Components:** Beyond printing, I operated machine lathes, drill presses, and milling machines to process plastic pieces and tubing for the hull assembly.
- **Dedicated Effort:** Dedicated **6+ hours per week** outside of standard lab hours to the fabrication and prototyping of the submarine.

## Software & Systems Integration

While focused on hardware, I contributed significantly to the electronic and software layers to ensure system cohesion.

- **Simulation & Logic:** Designed a software simulation for the IMU and sonar system collaboration. I also developed the distance tracking software used by the vehicle during autonomous operation.
- **Electronics:** Responsible for **PCB Soldering** and wiring numerous connections between the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and sensor arrays.
- **Technical Documentation:** Created all major milestone presentations and technical graphics to communicate the vehicle's design evolution.
