# Collegiate Wushu Tournament Medal

Custom commemorative medal design for the annual Collegiate Wushu Championship tournament, celebrating athletic achievement and traditional Chinese martial arts.

#### BACKGROUND

## Project Background

The UMD Wushu Club needed a distinctive medal design for their annual tournament that would:
- Honor the tradition of wushu martial arts
- Appeal to a collegiate audience
- Be manufacturable within budget constraints
- Stand out from typical generic sports medals

#### WHAT I DID

## Design Concept

The design incorporates traditional wushu symbolism:

### Visual Elements
- **Central motif**: Stylized representation of a wushu stance
- **Border pattern**: Inspired by traditional Chinese cloud patterns
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif balanced with cultural elements
- **Ribbon**: Red and gold colors representing traditional Chinese aesthetics

### Technical Considerations
- Designed for dual-sided casting
- Relief depth optimized for metal finishing
- Attachment point engineered for standard ribbon width
- Weight balanced for comfortable wearing

#### PROCESS

## Prototyping Phase

Initial prototypes were created using:
1. **FDM 3D printing** for quick concept validation
2. **Resin printing** for higher detail testing
3. **Silicone mold casting** for metal-like finish testing

The club officers and team members provided feedback on each iteration, leading to refinements in:
- Symbol clarity at small scale
- Text legibility
- Overall aesthetic balance

## Final Production

The final medals were manufactured through:
- Die casting in zinc alloy
- Antique gold plating
- Soft enamel color fill for accents
- Custom ribbon with heat-cut edges

#### IMPACT

## Impact

The medals were awarded to top performers across multiple categories:
- Forms competition (various styles)
- Sparring divisions (weight classes)
- Weapons demonstrations

Participants praised the unique design that honored both the sport's traditions and their personal achievements.

#### NEXT STEPS

## Future Iterations

Plans for next year include:
- Adding year-specific elements
- Exploring different metal finishes
- Creating a collector's series across tournament years

## Technical Details

- **Dimensions**: 3 inches diameter
- **Material**: Zinc alloy with gold plating
- **Weight**: 85 grams
- **Ribbon**: 1.5 inch grosgrain in red/gold
- **Production quantity**: 50 medals
