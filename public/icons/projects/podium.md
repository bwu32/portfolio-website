For the annual Collegiate Wushu Tournament, I was tasked with building a professional 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place podium. The primary constraint wasn't just supporting the weight of three athletes—it was storage. Our club storage space was severely limited, making a standard one-piece podium impossible to keep.

## The "Russian Doll" Engineering Solution

I originally designed the podium as a single massive unit, but quickly pivoted to a modular, "nesting" system to save space.

- **Modular Nesting:** I redesigned the three blocks to act like Russian nesting dolls, where the 3rd and 2nd place blocks fit entirely inside the 1st place block.
- **The Orientation Fix:** During the build, I realized the internal clearances were too tight. I had to "fanagle" the geometry of the 1st place block, extending its length in the back to create enough interior volume for the other two blocks to slide in smoothly.
- **Structural Integrity:** Despite being hollow to allow for nesting, each block was reinforced using traditional carpentry techniques to ensure it could safely support athletes during the medals ceremony.

## Materials & Aesthetic Finish

I wanted the podium to look like a professional tournament fixture rather than a shop project, so I utilized high-quality reclaimed materials.

- **The Standing Surface:** We used leftover wood with a high-quality pre-existing stain for the top layers. 
- **Traction & Safety:** After assembly, we noticed the stained wood was too slick for athletes (especially those in silk wushu shoes). I implemented a sanding pass on the top surfaces to increase traction without ruining the aesthetic.
- **The "Professional" Front:** For the face of the podium, I used a solid black painted plank. This gave the podium a clean, high-contrast look that stood out in photography and on the competition floor.



## Project Impact

The final podium was a staple of the competition, used throughout the event for all medalists. It proved that "collapsible" doesn't have to mean "flimsy." By applying an engineering mindset to a carpentry project, I was able to create a professional asset for the club that takes up only 1/3 of the storage space of a traditional podium.
