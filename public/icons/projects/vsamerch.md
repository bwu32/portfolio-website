MAUVSA stands for Mid Atlantic Union of Vietnamese Student Associations, and hosts a variety of events every year.Mauvsa Advance Conference (MAC) is the massive leadership conference for the Mid-Atlantic VSA region, and I was tasked with creating several distinct apparel lines for assorted committees and families.

## The "ALL DAY" Series (Official Merch)

I designed the "ALL DAY" lineup to reference the official mauvsa brand. Mauvsa has a slogan called MA ALL DAY, where MA is referencing mid atlantic.

- **Technical Execution:** Because I wanted precise spacing for the typography, I actually used **3D modeling software** (Fusion 360) to measure the scale of the design against garment dimensions before vectorizing in **Illustrator**.
- **Production:** These were manufactured using **DTG (Direct-to-Garment)** and high-quality heat transfers to ensure the intricate details of the text remained crisp across hundreds of units.

## Entertainment Committee

The Entertainment committee is the heart of the MAC culture show and late-night programming. I created a high-impact, bold design specifically for this team to stand out in the crowded conference halls.

- **Design Philosophy:** Used **Paint.NET** for initial raster layouts and texture work before finalizing the vectors. The look is meant to be "staff-exclusive," leaning into a modern, street-wear aesthetic that fits the energy of the performers and tech crew. Definitely made it more essentials and stussy vibes.

## Chi Hang Family Merch (DIY Special)

In VSA culture, "families" are the core social units. I collaborated directly with the **Chi Hang** family leader to create a design that felt personal and unique to their group.

- **DIY Production:** Unlike the mass-produced items, these were a labor of love. I used a **Cricut** to cut custom **Heat Transfer Vinyl (HTV)** and hand-pressed each garment using an iron. 
- **Collaboration:** This project was less about a "client" and more about a creative partnership, iterating on the design until it perfectly captured the "Chi Hang" family identity.

## Manufacturing & Workflow

This project was a massive exercise in **logistics** and **versatility**:
- **Diverse Methods:** Balanced professional outsourcing (DTG) with hands-on, artisanal production (HTV/Cricut).
- **Prototyping:** Used my skills in **Paint.NET** and **Illustrator** to create mockups that helped the MAUVSA board visualize the final product before we committed to a vendor.
- **Precision:** Applying **Fusion 360** to apparel design allowed me to treat the garment like an engineered part, ensuring perfect alignment for the "ALL DAY" chest and back prints.
