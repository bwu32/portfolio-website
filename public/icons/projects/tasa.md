Over the course of a year, I along with a co-graphic designer developed a series of branded physical assets for TASA, ranging from high-utility membership cards to celebratory pins and cute stickers. This project focused on blending modern design trends with traditional Taiwanese cultural symbols.

## 20th Anniversary Night Market Pin

As an exclusive item for the 20th anniversary of TASA's signature Night Market, I designed a commemorative enamel pin. 

- **Composition:** The pin features a central pink fan framed by a "ring" of branches, all gold plated.
- **Detailing:** Incorporates delicate Plum Blossom buds and a full bloom on the left side to celebrate the organization's longevity and cultural roots.

## Membership Cards

I wanted to elevate the standard student org membership card to something that felt like a premium "travel" asset. The membership card was used to redeem a variety of discounts at vendors and restaurants around campus.

- **Design Inspiration:** Modeled after the **Capital One Venture** card, focusing on clean lines and hidden details.
- **Symbolism:** Featured a "Half-Sun" motif representing a Taiwanese sunset, integrated with a **Plum Blossom** (Taiwan's national flower).
- **Specialty Finishes:** Engineered the design so the Plum Blossom is only visible from specific viewing angles, mimicking the holographic or spot-UV finishes found on premium credit cards.

## Stickers

Inspired by artist booths at **C2E2**, we developed a series of cute, food-centric animal stickers. 

- **Bao Bunnies:** A playful take on steamed "bao" buns reimagined as bunnies. The illustration features a chopstick lifting one "bao bunny" from a traditional bamboo steamer basket.
- **Pineapple Cake Cat:** A callback to our "Street Cat" merch, featuring the signature black cat stretching lazily across a traditional Taiwanese pineapple cake.

## Technical Execution

- **Vector Precision:** All designs were built in `Adobe Illustrator` and `Canva` to ensure line-weights remained consistent for small-scale physical production (pins and stickers).
- **Color Theory:** Balanced the vibrant "Night Market" pinks and oranges with the professional, muted tones of the membership cards.
