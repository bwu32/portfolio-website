# The Highborn: A Custom Lightsaber Design

A custom lightsaber design that was designed and manufactured in collaboration with ThePachStore. This project achieved mass production with over 3000+ units sold worldwide.

#### WHAT I DID

## Project Overview

The Highborn represents a unique blend of aesthetic appeal and functional ergonomics, designed specifically for lightsaber combat enthusiasts. The design needed to balance visual impact with practical usability during choreographed combat.

## Design Process

The initial concept phase involved:

- Sketching multiple hilt variations
- Gathering feedback from the lightsaber combat community
- Creating detailed CAD models in Fusion 360
- Running ergonomic tests with prototype prints

The final design features a distinctive angular pommel and grip section that provides superior control during spinning techniques.

#### CHALLENGES

## Manufacturing Challenges

### CNC Machining

The manufacturing process required precision CNC machining to achieve the tight tolerances needed for:
- Internal electronics housing
- Threaded connections between hilt sections
- Smooth finish on external surfaces

Each component underwent multiple machining operations:
1. Rough cut from aluminum stock
2. Precision turning for cylindrical sections
3. Detailed milling for decorative elements
4. Final surface finishing

### Electronics Integration

Integrating the electronics required careful attention to:
- PCB design and soldering
- Sound module placement
- LED heat dissipation
- Battery compartment accessibility

#### PROCESS

## Post-Processing

After machining, each unit received:
- Sandblasting for surface texture
- Anodizing in various color options
- Clear coating for durability
- Quality control inspection

#### IMPACT

## Reception

The Highborn became one of ThePachStore's best-selling designs, praised for its:
- Unique aesthetic that stands out in collections
- Comfortable grip during extended use
- Durability in combat situations
- Balance and weight distribution

## Technical Specifications

- **Length**: 11 inches (hilt only)
- **Diameter**: 1.5 inches (grip section)
- **Weight**: 14 oz (without blade)
- **Material**: 6061 aluminum
- **Finish**: Type II anodized

#### NEXT STEPS

## Reflections

This project taught me valuable lessons about designing for manufacturability at scale. Working with ThePachStore's production team helped me understand the constraints and possibilities of CNC manufacturing, which has informed all my subsequent product design work.
