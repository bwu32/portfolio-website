For my school's VSA Culture Show (Family Night 47), I was tasked with creating "spy-grade" sidearms for our lead characters. To comply with campus safety regulations regarding realistic prop weapons, I decided to "tacti-cool" (holy tactics batman) the most unassuming blaster in existence: the **Nerf Jolt**. The result was a functional, stylized suppressed pistol that looked professional on stage while remaining clearly a toy.

## Engineering Challenges & Iteration

Converting a tiny, top-heavy one-shot blaster into a sleek spy pistol required a major shift in my design approach.

- **Structural Stability:** Initially, I tried to mount the suppressor directly to the end of the orange barrel, but the design was too wide and unstable. I eventually realized I needed to **extend the main body of the weapon itself**. I designed a custom sleeve that clips onto the Jolt’s chassis without glue, providing a stable foundation for the integrated barrel.
- **The Suppressor:** I engineered a custom-length barrel that maintained the "suppressed" aesthetic without ruining the blaster's balance. I made sure to leave the tip orange to comply with prop gun safety mandates.
- **The Magnetic Sight:** I added a top-rail sight that attached via **5mm Neodymium magnets**. While it looked great, the high vibration from the Jolt's plunger impact actually proved to be too strong for the magnets, leading to some "battle damage" during high-intensity testing.

## Aesthetics & Finish

Since these were for a live performance, they needed to pop under stage lights.

- **Color Palette:** I moved away from the "Nerf Blue" and went with a sophisticated **Copper and Gold** metallic finish. I used my experience in **Automotive Painting & Finishing** to ensure the coat was even and durable enough for actors to handle.
- **Commemorative Branding:** The side of the frame features "FAMILY NIGHT 47" text, both as a reminder that it's a prop and a way to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the show.

## Lessons Learned

- **Vibration Management:** This was a great lesson in **Mechanical Engineering**. Neodymium magnets are strong, but they are brittle and don't always handle sharp, impulsive shocks well. If I were to do a V2, I’d look into a mechanical locking rail or rubber-dampened magnetic seats.
- **Stage Visibility:** Designing for stage is different than designing for a desk. The proportions had to be slightly exaggerated so the "silencer" profile was recognizable even from the back row of the auditorium.
