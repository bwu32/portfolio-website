# Rushed Hour

"Rushed Hour" is a high-energy parody of the classic *Rush Hour* films, blending martial arts stunts with absurd, language-barrier-driven comedy. I wore a lot of hats for this one—I was on screen as an actor, behind the scenes helping direct the commercial vision, and deep in the weeds of the final edit.

## The Story & Creative Vision

The script centers on the kidnapping of the Vietnamese Ambassador’s sister, forcing the brash Detective Cartman to team up with the lethal Detective Inspector Le. 

- **Commercial Inspiration:** I helped brainstorm and execute the "commercial" style for the project’s promotional material, using my creative vision to make it feel like a big-budget action trailer despite our indie roots.

## The Editing Suite: Premiere Pro & Post-Production

This project was a turning point for my videography skills. The main writer of the film was my big and mentor, and I spent hours learning the "invisible" side of filmmaking.

- **Scene Pacing:** I helped edit all the major scenes, learning how to cut action sequences so the hits felt impactful. This involved a lot of frame-by-frame adjustments in **Premiere Pro** to sync Foley sounds with the stunt team's movements.
- **Style Overlays:** We played with specific color grading and stylistic overlays to mimic that late-90s/early-2000s action movie aesthetic.
- **Audio Cleanup:** Used **Audacity** to handle the dialogue levels, especially for the high-energy scenes where we had a lot of background noise and shouting.

## Key Takeaways

Acting in a film while also editing it is a trip—it definitely makes you a better actor because you start to realize exactly what "coverage" the editor needs. Working with my friend/mentor taught me specific **Premiere Pro** workflows that I still use today, specifically regarding project organization and how to handle multi-cam stunt sequences.

`Personal Highlight:` Wearing this blond wig I've had since freshman year, ironically also for a film.
