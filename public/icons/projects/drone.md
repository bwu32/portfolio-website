Collaborated with Professor Romel Gomez to engineer a mobile, zero-tolerance landing platform designed for integration with a robotic quadruped. The system enables precise capture and secure magnetic interlock of a drone from any landing angle, facilitating autonomous deployment and retrieval in dynamic environments.

## Technical Execution

The platform utilizes a **`rotating landing pad`** driven by a custom ring-and-spur gear assembly mounted on a ball-bearing aluminum ring. To ensure a secure "catch," the system employs **`linear actuators`** that manipulate the proximity of high-strength magnets to the central core.

- **Zero-Tolerance Docking:** Engineered custom drone landing gear with magnetic interfaces that lock into the rotating core upon contact.
- **Precision Fabrication:** Developed proprietary mechanical connection points to ensure structural integrity while minimizing reliance on adhesives.
- **Material Optimization:** Integrated a thin **`Plexiglass`** surface to provide structural rigidity without sacrificing magnetic flux density.

## Prototyping & Iteration

The project underwent extensive **`rapid prototyping`** to refine the gear tolerances and actuator throw.

- **Iterative Design:** Utilized both **`Fusion 360`** and **`SolidWorks`** for CAD modeling and FEA to ensure the gear assembly could withstand the rotational torque and landing impact.
- **Digital Fabrication:** Produced multiple functional prototypes using **`FDM and SLA 3D printing`**, iterating on the spur gear tooth profile for smooth engagement with the aluminum bearing ring.
- **Assembly:** Final assembly utilized a standardized **`M4 hardware`** architecture for ease of maintenance and modularity.
