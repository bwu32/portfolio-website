I’ve always felt that the biggest flaw in home-brew board games is that they become static—once you know the "meta," the game feels the same every time. I designed **CANEge** specifically to solve that. It’s a game where the rules, the board, and even the player interactions are in a state of constant, chaotic flux. 

## The Core Concept: "The Rule Modifier"

The central play feature of CANEge is that the rules are never set in stone.
- **Rule Cards:** Every turn, players draw cards that act as active modifiers. These can change the fundamental "engine" of the game—modifying how many cards you can draw, how many you can play, or which rules are currently active.
- **Board Modification:** The game isn't just about moving pieces; it’s about moving the world. Cards can force players to reorder the 8 mini-boards, splitting them apart or fusing them into new configurations mid-game. 

## 3D Design & Modular Engineering

To make a game that changes every time, I had to build a physical system that could keep up. I used my background in **3D Design** to create a fully modular ecosystem.

- **The Modular Board:** Instead of one static fold-out, I engineered **8 interlocking mini-boards**. They are designed to be "hot-swappable" so that the layout of the game can be completely transformed without stopping play.
- **Thematic Pieces:** I 3D modeled and printed custom player tokens shaped like **Candy Canes** to fit the game's aesthetic (hence the name CANE-ge).
- **Custom Dice:** I even 3D printed the dice myself—which was a fun experiment in infill and weight distribution (though they may or may not be slightly rigged depending on who you ask).

## Graphic Design & Production

Every physical element was designed to look and feel like a professional retail product.

- **Laminated Cardstock:** I designed and handmade the entire deck of rule modifier cards. Each card was custom-designed in **Illustrator**, printed on heavy cardstock, and laminated for durability.
- **Storage Solutions:** To keep the chaos organized, I designed a custom **card holder and game box** to house the modular boards and 3D printed components.

`The Takeaway:` This project was a massive experiment in **Game Theory**. It forced me to move away from static systems and think about how to balance a game where the variables are constantly shifting. It showcases the full pipeline—from 3D printing modular parts to high-end graphic design for the UI/UX of the cards.
