For the ENES100 (Introduction to Engineering Design) keystone project, my team built an Over Surface Vehicle (OSV) designed to autonomously navigate a complex obstacle course, identify topography, and extinguish simulated fires. I headed up the mechanical structural design and the overall "brand identity" of the vehicle, ensuring we didn't just meet mission objectives but did it with the flair of a Piston Cup champion.

## Mechanical & Systems Engineering

I was responsible for the entire physical architecture of the Mikequeen. This meant balancing the "thematic shell" with the heavy functional requirements of an autonomous robot.

- **Fire Suppression & Mechanisms:** Engineered the fire suppression system and all movement-critical hardware, including custom motor mounts and secure electronic component holders.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Led the design evolution through three major stages—moving from an exposed-wheel initial design to a fully integrated, aerodynamic shroud that seamlessly housed the fan covers and sensors.
- **Custom Integration:** 3D modeled and printed bespoke parts for the chassis, including a "zero-tolerance" assembly for the fan shrouds and internal LED systems for that underglow aesthetic.

## The "Lightning" Motif

I handled the visual design to make our team stand out in the lab.

- **Thematic Shell:** Designed the 3D-printed body and fan covers to mimic Lightning McQueen.
- **Branding & Merch:** Created custom stickers, team paraphernalia, and even "Raspa-eze" (Fire Ointment) sponsor graphics in **Adobe Illustrator** and **Canva** to complete the look.

## Performance & Lessons

We clocked in with a **140/240 points overall**. While our navigation was solid and we detected the topography accurately, we ran into the classic "sudden battery workaround" which prevented us from hitting the fire suppression goals during the final run. 

`Technical Takeaway:` This project was a masterclass in **Improvising/Thinking on the Fly** and highlighted the importance of **Efficient Usage of Time** when dealing with 3D print cycles and hardware failures.

`Awards`: We were nominated for Best Design across all OSV projects and sections in the course.
