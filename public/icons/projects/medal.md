Commissioned to design the official award medals for the 26th Annual Collegiate Wushu Tournament hosted at the University of Maryland. The design balances traditional martial arts aesthetics with specific cultural and institutional identifiers, resulting in a dual-sided custom commemorative piece.

## Design Concept & Symbology

The visual narrative of the medal centers on the intersection of the tournament's legacy and the 2025 Chinese Zodiac.

- **The Ouroboros Motif:** Inspired by the Year of the Snake, the design features a snake motif integrated into the **number 26**. The snake body wraps around the rim of the medal in an Ouroboros-style loop, symbolizing continuity and the cyclical nature of martial arts practice.
- **Institutional Identity:** The reverse side features a geometric **turtle shell pattern**, a direct reference to the University of Maryland Terrapins mascot, grounding the event in its host location.
- **Seamless Transition:** Elements of the snake motif fluidly wrap from the face to the back of the medal, creating a 3D tactile experience rather than two disconnected surfaces.

## Technical Workflow

`Fusion 360` was utilized to bridge the gap between 2D graphic art and 3D manufacturing-ready assets.

- **Vector Translation:** Initial patterns and the custom "26" typography were drafted in **Adobe Illustrator** before being imported as sketches into CAD.
- **Surface Modeling:** Used **Fusion 360** to create the organic curves of the snake body and the precise geometric relief of the Terrapin shell.
- **Manufacturing Prep:** Optimized the relief depths and draft angles to ensure the design was suitable for high-quality metal casting and finishing.
