# The Highborn Lightsaber

What started as a 3 AM design sprint fueled by running out of silver 3D printer filament turned into a global commercial product. I decided to lean into a Black and Gold aesthetic out of necessity, posted the result on Reddit, and ended up being scouted by **ThePachStore**. The design went into mass production and has since sold **3,000+ units** worldwide.

## The Story

I didn't actually expect this to go anywhere. I was a junior in high school just vibing and 3D printing my own designs. After 4 iterations of the "accidentally gold" hilt, the owner of ThePachStore reached out to me directly on **r/lightsabers** to collaborate on a production run. 

I worked with their team to refine the geometry for manufacturing, resulting in the "Highborn"—a hilt that has become a staple in the custom saber community.

## Technical & Manufacturing

This project was my gateway into professional-grade fabrication. While the consumer version was mass-produced, I used the opportunity to get hands-on with the manufacturing process myself.

- **CAD to Reality:** Refined the design in `Fusion 360` to ensure the thin necks and deep grooves were viable for high-volume CNC work.
- **Machining:** This was my first exposure to **CNC Milling and Turning (Lathe)**. I spent time in a workshop learning how to actually take a design from a 3D model to a weighted, aluminum reality.
- **Electronics:** I handled the internal chassis design and `PCB Soldering` for my personal units, integrating soundboards and LED drivers into the tight tolerances of the hilt.

**Total Units Sold:** 3,000+
**Top Post:** Gained significant traction on Reddit, leading to the professional partnership.
